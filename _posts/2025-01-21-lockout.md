title: All Possible Goals in Minecraft Lockout 1.19
subtitle: Mined from atsign's CurseForge mod

SmallAnt's mod Minecraft Lockout is a 2-team game where each teams are given the same set of 25 goals to complete. The teams then race to complete the goals as fast as possible, with a goal becoming unavailable to one team once it is completed by the other: the first to 13 wins. Individuals can also play a Blackout variant where they must complete all 25 goals.

The mod's description does not provide a list of all possible goals, but by downloading the raw source code from CurseForge we can mine for the set of possible goal texts. There are 204 distinct goals available in the source code, though in practice there are far more than 204 goal permutations since some goals -- i.e. Kill A (Random Color of) Sheep, or Obtain 64 of (Any Randomly Chosen Wool Type) -- contain random elements in their definitions. 

I've left the list of goal texts in the same order they're defined in the source code, but added some subgroupings to classify the type of each goal. Some of these are straightforward (the Eat goals), while others involve some more creative liberty and one (Miscellaneous) doesn't really fit together at all.

All goals here exist as of the 1.19 version of the mod on CurseForge.
