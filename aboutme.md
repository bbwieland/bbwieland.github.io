title: Who Am I?
---

Currently, I develop generative Bayesian models as a quantitative analyst for the Philadelphia Phillies within the organization's predictive modeling department.

Previously, I worked as a research and development trainee for the Atlanta Braves and as a data analyst at the basketball analytics company ShotQuality. I earned bachelor's degrees in history & applied statistics at the University of Virginia in May 2024. 

I maintain the `fRisbee` R package for [open-source access to Ultimate Frisbee data](https://github.com/bbwieland/fRisbee/).
